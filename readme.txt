= Any ideas for making badge images? =

Yes! After installing BadgeOS, enable Credly Integration in the BadgeOS menu. That will seamlessly integrate the Credly "[Badge Builder](https://credly.com/badge-builder-home "Credly tool for designing badge images")" into your WordPress site so you can design your own professional-looking badge images.  (First get a [free account](https://credly.com/#!/create-account "Create a free Credly account") at Credly.com if you do not have one.)

= Can you help us design custom badge images? =

Yes, our designers are available to create custom badges that represent your brand, the kind of achievements you recognize, and the audience you are reaching.  From a single badge to a complete constellation, our team of professional badge designers get to know your needs through a tested Badge Design Process which consistently produces successful and delightful results.

= Do you offer services to help us design, build or customize our BadgeOS site? =

Yes, we do. We especially enjoy working on innovative projects with forward-thinking teams extending achievement recognition into new environments and surfacing achievement in new ways. See [examples](http://badgeos.org/about/sample-sites/ "Sample pojects") and learn more at: [http://badgeos.org/services/badgeos-customization/](http://badgeos.org/services/badgeos-customization/ "BadgeOS Customization").

= Where should I report issues or bugs? =

The ideal place for bug and issue reporting is on the [GitHub](https://github.com/opencredit/badgeos "BadgeOS on GitHub") site for the BadgeOS project.

= Where should I contribute code back to the project? =

Thanks for asking!  Please do share back code modifications or enhancements you make for inclusion in BadgeOS core or as add-ons. (Functions that are specialized for just some users are likely best as add-on plugins to BadgeOS. We can help figure that out with you.) Visit us on [GitHub](https://github.com/opencredit/badgeos "BadgeOS on GitHub") to share your code with the BadgeOS community.

= Credly is really cool. How can I learn more about it? =

[Credly](https://credly.com/ "Credly web site") is the universal way to recognize, store and share life's achievements. We've integrated Credly into BadgeOS because it's downright the easiest, most fun way to collect evidence of all your achievements in one place and then share them out when and where it matters most. There are a rapidly growing number of platforms and apps that are using the Credly "Open Credit" API to enable sharable badges; the BadgeOS WordPress integration is just one great example! Visit us [Credly.com](https://credly.com "Credly on the Web") to learn more or [contact](https://credly.com/contact "Contact us") us for guidance with using the free Open Credit API in your own projects or applications.
